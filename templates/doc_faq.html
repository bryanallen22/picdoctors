      <p class='question'>Who can become a Pic Doctor?</p>
      <p class='answer'>
      Due to restrictions from our payments provider, you must be a US resident with a bank account to become
      a Pic Doctor. We hope that this changes in the coming months!

      <p class='question'>How am I protected as a Doctor?</p>
      <p class='answer'>
      As a doctor we protect you by watermarking your images until a user has accepted your work as
      valid and complete.  Likewise we've put a hold on the user's account to verify that they can pay
      for the work.

      <p class='question'>What is a merchant account, and why do I need it?</p>
      <p class='answer'>
       For an in depth look at merchant accounts
       <u><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account'>view the wikipedia page here.</a></u>
       Essentially a merchant account allows you to accept payment from a user.  This is how you as a
       doctor will receive your payments.  It's fully integrated into our site so you don't have to
       navigate between our site and our payment processing partner.

      <p class='question'>What happens if the user isn't happy with my work?</p>
      <p class='answer'>
      We encourage users to request modifications to your work, but they have the option of
      returning the job to the market. If this happens, you won't be paid. We hope it doesn't
      happen often!

      <p class='question'>How do I withdraw my earnings?</p>
      <p class='answer'>
      Just visit <a href="{% url 'withdraw' %}">the withdraw page</a> and have
      the money transferred to your account. The minimum amount that you can
      withdraw at a time is {{ minimum_withdraw | currency_dollars }}.

      How am I paid as a Doctor?
    </h4>
    Doctor's are given a base pay of 50% with a possible maximum of 70%.  Your possible payout is
    calculated when you take a job.  The calculated value depends on the amount of accepted pictures
    you've had in the last 30 days and your overall rating as a doctor(Tier 2 and above). When the user accepts your
    work the possible payout is then credited to your merchant account.
