      <a class='question'>Who can become a Pic Doctor?</a>
      <p class='answer'>
      Due to restrictions from our payments provider, you must be a US resident with a bank account to become
      a Pic Doctor. We hope that this changes in the coming months!

      <a class='question'>How much am I paid?</a>
      <p class='answer'>
      There is a base payout for each job, and you can earn between 100% of the base payout and 140% of the base payout.  Additionally Stripe will charge a fee of their own, we will front that fee (whatever that may be).  Your possible payout is calculated when you take a job. Two factors impact your cut:

      <a class='question'>How am I protected as a Doctor?</a>
      <p class='answer'>
      As a doctor we protect you by watermarking your images until a user has accepted your work as
      valid and complete.  Likewise we've put a hold on the user's account to verify that they can pay
      for the work.

      <a class='question'>What is a merchant account, and why do I need it?</a>
      <p class='answer'>
       For an in depth look at merchant accounts
       <u><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account'>view the wikipedia page here.</a></u>
       Essentially a merchant account allows you to accept payment from a user.  This is how you as a
       doctor will receive your payments.  It's fully integrated into our site so you don't have to
       navigate between our site and our payment processing partner.

      <a class='question'>Who can see my work?</a>
      <p class='answer'>
      Right now, the job can only be seen if the user allows sharing.

      <a class='question'>What happens if the user isn't happy with my work?</a>
      <p class='answer'>
      We encourage users to request modifications to your work, but they have the option of
      returning the job to the market. If this happens, you won't be paid. We hope it doesn't
      happen often!

      <p class='answer'>
      Yep. Just use the 'comments' below the pictures, and we'll notify them.

      <a class='question'>How do I withdraw my earnings?</a>

      It will be in your stripe account. You can set your stripe account up to automatically deposit into your bank account.
