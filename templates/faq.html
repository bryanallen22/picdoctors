      Who can see my pictures?
    </h4>
    At PicDoctors.com we understand how important privacy is.  When you upload your pictures they
    are visible to our Pic Doctors.  Once a Pic Doctor has taken on your job, your pictures are only
    visible to that Pic Doctor and you.

    <h4>
      Can I get a refund?
    </h4>
    Yes!  We want you to be completely satisfied.  You can get a refund all the way until you accept
    the Doctor's work.  Once the Doctor's work has been accepted your payment is released to the
    Doctor.

    <h4>
      How am I paid as a Doctor?
    </h4>
    Doctor's are given a base pay of 50% with a possible maximum of 70%.  Your possible payout is
    calculated when you take a job.  The calculated value depends on the amount of accepted pictures
    you've had in the last 30 days and your overall rating as a doctor(Tier 2 and above). When the user accepts your
    work the possible payout is then credited to your merchant account.

    <h4>
     How am I protected as a Doctor? 
    </h4>
    As a doctor we protect you by watermarking your images until a user has accepted your work as
    valid and complete.  Likewise we've put a hold on the user's account to verify that they can pay
    for the work.

     What is a merchant account, and why do I need it? 
   </h4>
   For an in depth look at merchant accounts 
   <u><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account'>view the wikipedia page Here.</a></u>
   Essentially a merchant account allows you to accept payment from a user.  This is how you as a
   doctor will receive your payments.  It's fully integrated into our site so you don't have to
   navigate between our site and our payment processing partner.
