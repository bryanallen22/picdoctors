      Who can see my pictures?
    </h4>
    At PicDoctors.com we understand how important privacy is.  When you upload your pictures they
    are visible to our Pic Doctors.  Once a Pic Doctor has taken on your job, your pictures are only
    visible to that Pic Doctor and you.

    <h4>
      Can I get a refund?
    </h4>
    Yes!  We want you to be completely satisfied.  You can get a refund all the way until you accept
    the Doctor's work.  Once the Doctor's work has been accepted your payment is released to the
    Doctor.

      How am I paid as a Doctor?
    </h4>
    Doctor's are given a base pay of 50% with a possible maximum of 70%.  When you take a job your
    possible payout is calculated.  The calculated value depends on the amount of accepted pictures
    you've had in the last 30 days and your overall rating as a doctor. When the user accepts your
    work the possible payout is then credited to your merchant account.

    <h4>
     How am I protected as a Doctor? 
    </h4>
    As a doctor we protect you by watermarking your images until a user has accepted your work as
    valid and complete.  Likewise we've put a hold on the user's account to verify that they can pay
    for the work.
