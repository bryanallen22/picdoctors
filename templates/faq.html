      <p class='question'>Who can see my pictures?</p>
      <p class='answer'>
      At PicDoctors.com we understand how important privacy is.  When you upload your pictures they
      are visible to our Pic Doctors.  Once a Pic Doctor has taken on your job, your pictures are only
      visible to that Pic Doctor and you.

      Yes!  We want you to be completely satisfied.  You can get a refund all the way until you accept

      Doctor.

      <p class='question'>Can I share my pictures with friends and family?</p>
      <div class='answer'>
        <p>Yes!  We want you to be able to share and allow others to enjoy the work that's been done to your images.  Not only is it fun for you, but it shows off the skills of your doctor which is greatly appreciated.  By default we block your album from being viewed by anyone other than you and the Pic Doctor.  There are three places where you can make your album shareable.</p>
        <li> When you accept the doctor's work you are given the opportunity to allow your album to be shared (checkbox).</li>
        <li> From the job's page, you can choose share album. </li>
        <li> From the album page there is a link beside the social media links at the bottom of each image which will allow you to share the album</li>
