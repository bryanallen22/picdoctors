      Don't limit yourself to this list.  Feel free to ask for your high school picture to be altered so it looks like you're flying a rocket ship.  The best part is you have nothing
      to lose.  You aren't charged until you receive the results you're looking for.

      <p class='answer'>
         This service is a name your price service.  
         There is a minimum of $5 dollars per output picture, but beside that it's up to you on how much you're willing to pay.
         If your job isn't receiving enough interest you can raise the price.  Remember, you aren't charged until you accept the Doctor's work, so there is no risk involved.  Here are some possible price suggestions:

      <a class='question' href='#authorization_hold' name='authorization_hold'>What's this 50 cent charge that I see on my credit card statement?</a>
      <p class='answer'>
        When you create a job, we temporarily create a $0.50 authorization hold, <em>which we immediately release</em>.
        We do this to ensure that the card that you have entered is valid.
      </p>
      <p class='answer'>
        Some credit card companies will show this for a few days as a pending charge. If you see this, rest assured
        that it will disappear soon.

      <a class='question' href='#pending_charge' name='pending_charge'>Why do I see a charge on my credit card statement before I've accepted the Doctor's work?</a>
      <p class='answer'>
        This is just a standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_hold">authorization hold</a>. It helps us guarantee to the Doctor that their money will be available if you accept their work. It will only become an actual charge only if you accept the Doctor's work. If you aren't happy with the Doctor's work, we'll release this hold and you won't be charged.

      <p class='answer'>
      At PicDoctors.com we understand how important privacy is.  When you upload your pictures they
      are visible to our Pic Doctors.  Once a Pic Doctor has taken on your job, your pictures are only
      visible to that Pic Doctor and you.

      <div class='answer'>
        <p>Yes!  We want you to be able to share and allow others to enjoy the work that's been done to your images.  Not only is it fun for you, but it shows off the skills of your Doctor which is greatly appreciated.  By default we block your album from being viewed by anyone other than you and the Pic Doctor.  There are three places where you can make your album shareable.</p>
        <li> When you accept the Doctor's work you are given the opportunity to allow your album to be shared (checkbox).</li>
        <li> From the job's page, you can choose share album. </li>
        <li> From the album page there is a link beside the social media links at the bottom of each image which will allow you to share the album</li>
