        Choose how much you are willing to pay for the job. We'll place a temporary hold
        on your card for the chosen amount, but we won't charge it yet. By offering more,
        you're more likely to get an experienced, trusted Pic Doctor. If your job isn't taken at
        the price you offer, we'll let you know.

      <p>
        Once the Pic Doctor completes the work, you can approve a watermarked version.
        If you want further modifications, you can request them. If you aren't satisfied,
        you can put the job back on the public market or request a refund. <strong>You won't
        be charged unless you are satisfied.</strong>
