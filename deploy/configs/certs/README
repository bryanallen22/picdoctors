Here's a list of the files in here, and what they were:

This is a bogus cert. It mostly follows http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSslModule,
but it has 2048 bits instead of 1024.
  bogus.crt
  bogus.csr
  bogus.key -- does not require a password
  bogus.key.orig -- does require password 'asdf'

Then there's the real picdoctors ssl key:
  picdoctors.csr
  picdoctors.key -- requires key (key not given here)
  picdoctors_nopassword.key
  picdoctors_bundle.crt, which is the cat of these (in this order):
    www_picdoctors_com.crt
    PositiveSSLCA2.crt
    AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt
